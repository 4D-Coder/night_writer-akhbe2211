## ⠑Some History⠑

Braille is a system that enables blind and visually impaired people to read and write
through touch. It was devised by Louis Braille in 1821 and consists of raised dots
arranged in "cells." A cell is made up of six dots that fit under the fingertips, arranged in
two columns of three dots each. Each cell represents a letter, a word, a combination of
letters, a numeral or a punctuation mark.
